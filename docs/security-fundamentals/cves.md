# Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE)

A **Common Vulnerability Enumeration**, or **CVE**, is a security flaw that has been discovered in an open source software package. We can think of CVEs like report cards for problems identified in computer programs.

1. **CVE ID**: A unique identifier for the CVE
2. **Description**: A description of what the problem is and why
3. **Impact**: An explanation of how bad the problem potentially is
4. **Severity Score (CVSS)**: A number that tells us how serious the problem is
5. **Reference**: Links or notes with additional information about the problem
